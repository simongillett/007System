# x402 Payment Reference

Makes HTTP requests to APIs protected by the [x402 payment protocol](https://x402.org). When a route returns HTTP 402, the script signs the returned EIP-3009 USDC payment challenge locally and retries the request.

Your private key stays local and is never sent to any server.

## Prerequisites

Python 3.9+ with `requests`, `eth-account`, and `eth-abi`:

```bash
pip install requests eth-account eth-abi
```

The script is at `scripts/x402_payment.py`. Run it from the `chainlink-for-agents/` skill root.

Your EVM wallet must hold USDC on the target payment network.

## Usage

```bash
cd chainlink-for-agents
export AGENT_PRIVATE_KEY="0x..."
python scripts/x402_payment.py \
  --url "$CHAINLINK_AGENTS_URL/v1/catalog/some-paid-endpoint" \
  --method GET \
  --max-amount-usdc 1.0
```

## Arguments

| Argument | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `--private-key KEY` | env | Hex private key. Also reads `AGENT_PRIVATE_KEY` or `EVM_PRIVATE_KEY`. |
| `--url URL` | required | Full URL of the API endpoint. |
| `--method METHOD` | `POST` | HTTP method: `GET` or `POST`. |
| `--body JSON` | `{}` | JSON request body for POST requests. |
| `--headers JSON` | `{}` | Additional headers as a JSON object. |
| `--max-amount-usdc FLOAT` | no limit | Safety cap: refuse to pay more than this amount in USDC. |

## Output

```json
{
  "status": 200,
  "paid": true,
  "payment_network": "base",
  "payment_amount_usdc": 0.001,
  "data": { }
}
```

If HTTP 402 is received but payment fails, the script exits with a non-zero status and prints error details to stderr.

## How x402 Works

1. The client makes the HTTP request normally.
2. The server responds with HTTP 402 and payment requirements.
3. The client selects an `exact` payment option from the challenge.
4. The client signs an EIP-3009 `TransferWithAuthorization` message for USDC locally.
5. The client retries the request with a payment authorization header.
6. The payment facilitator verifies and settles the payment, then the API returns the response.

No on-chain transaction is broadcast by the client.

## EIP-3009 Challenge Payload

For x402 v2 responses, `scripts/x402_payment.py` reads the `PAYMENT-REQUIRED` header and retries with `PAYMENT-SIGNATURE`. The retry header is base64-encoded JSON shaped like this:

```json
{
  "x402Version": 2,
  "accepted": {
    "scheme": "exact",
    "network": "eip155:8453",
    "asset": "0x...",
    "amount": "100000",
    "payTo": "0x..."
  },
  "payload": {
    "authorization": {
      "from": "0x...",
      "to": "0x...",
      "value": "100000",
      "validAfter": "1713700000",
      "validBefore": "1713700600",
      "nonce": "0x...",
      "v": 27,
      "r": "0x...",
      "s": "0x..."
    },
    "signature": "0x..."
  }
}
```

The `accepted` object is copied from the server challenge and normalized only to include `amount` when the challenge used `maxAmountRequired`. Do not rebuild or trim it manually: gateways may reject otherwise-valid signatures with errors such as `No matching payment requirements` when the `accepted` requirements do not match the challenge.

## Common USDC Networks

| Network | Chain ID | USDC Address |
|---------|----------|--------------|
| base-sepolia | 84532 | `0x036CbD53842c5426634e7929541eC2318f3dCF7e` |
| base | 8453 | `0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913` |
| sepolia | 11155111 | `0x1c7D4B196Cb0C7B01d743Fbc6116a902379C7238` |

The helper supports additional named networks. If the server returns an unlisted EVM network, use `eip155:<chain_id>` format when adapting the helper.

## Security

- The private key is passed as a CLI argument or environment variable and is never sent over the network.
- The script verifies the payment amount against `--max-amount-usdc` before signing.
- Prefer the environment variable form to avoid shell history exposure:

```bash
export AGENT_PRIVATE_KEY=0x...
cd chainlink-for-agents
python scripts/x402_payment.py --url "..." --body "..."
```
